Hi! Welcome aboard the **HCSS (Human Computer Space Shuttle)**! We are so excited to have you
joining us this week. Today, you'll be steering the HCSS to help guide us to safety.

**Your Task:** Control the spaceship and dodge the falling asteroids for as long as
possible without crashing. 

**How To Play:**
Player 1 should use the **ARROW** keys to move your ship left, right, up, and down.
Player 2 should use the **ASWD** keys to move their ship left, right, up, and down.
Avoid touching any of the asteroids that fall from the top of the screen.
If the ship collides with an asteroid or another ship, the game ends with a **crash**.
