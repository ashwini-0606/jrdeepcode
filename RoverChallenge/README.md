The Rover Challenge is a series of challenges you will complete to simulate code written by real NASA engineers for Mars exploration.

Challenge 1: Program your robot to move in a square. Go from the starting point to the ending point.

Challenge 2: Avoid Hazards. Program your rover to detect objects, stop, then turn to avoid a collision.
  - Try testing how close is too close.

Challenge 3: Solar Charge. Program your mBot to detect where there is a lot of light. Have the mBot stay where there is a lot of sun to charge.
